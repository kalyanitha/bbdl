Code Breakdown
python
Copy code

x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 7, 3, 5, 2])
np.array([1, 2, 3, 7, 3, 5, 2]): This creates a 1-dimensional NumPy array x with 7 elements. This array can be thought of as a vector.
python
Copy code

y = np.array([[1], [3], [5], [7], [8], [8], [2]])
np.array([[1], [3], [5], [7], [8], [8], [2]]): This creates a 2-dimensional NumPy array y with 7 rows and 1 column. Each element of this array is enclosed in its own sub-array, so it is effectively a column vector.
Multiplication
python
Copy code
c = x * y
x * y: This line performs element-wise multiplication of x and y. Since x is a 1D array (a row vector) and y is a 2D array (a column vector), NumPy uses broadcasting to perform this operation.
Broadcasting Explanation
Broadcasting is a set of rules NumPy uses to perform element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes. Here’s how it works in this case:

Shape Alignment: NumPy aligns the shapes of x and y to perform element-wise operations. x (shape (7,)) is broadcasted to match the shape of y (shape (7, 1)). In this context, x is considered as if it were a column vector with shape (7, 1) for the purpose of broadcasting.

Element-wise Multiplication:

Each element of x is multiplied by the corresponding element of y.
The result is a new 2D array where each element in the row of x is multiplied by each corresponding element in the column of y.
So the multiplication x * y results in:

Copy code
[[1*1],
 [2*3],
 [3*5],
 [7*7],
 [3*8],
 [5*8],
 [2*2]]
=
[[ 1],
 [ 6],
 [15],
 [49],
 [24],
 [40],
 [ 4]]
Printing the Result
python
Copy code

print("Multiplication of Vector and Matrix: \n", c)
print("\n")
print("Multiplication of Vector and Matrix: \n", c): This prints the result of the multiplication operation c. The result is displayed with a message indicating that it’s the result of the vector and matrix multiplication.
Summary

Vector x: A 1D array (vector) with 7 elements.
Matrix y: A 2D column vector (7x1 matrix).
Element-wise Multiplication: The code multiplies each element of x by the corresponding element of y, using broadcasting to align their shapes for the multiplication. The result is a 2D array where each element of x is multiplied by the corresponding element of y.
